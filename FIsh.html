      <b>Fish</b> are aquatic vertebrate animals that have gills but lack limbs
      with digits, like fingers or toes. Recall that vertebrates are animals
      with <a href=" internal "skeletons. Fish are vertebrates (vertebrates have backbones)
      that live in water.>
    </p>

    <h2>General Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
      Most fish are cold-blooded, their body temperature varying with the
      surrounding water, though some large active swimmers like white sharks and
      tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Many fish can communicate
      acoustically with each other, such as during courtship displays. The study
      of fish is known as ichthyology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest fish appeared during the Cambrian as small filter feeders;
      they continued to evolve through the Paleozoic, diversifying into many
      forms. The earliest fish with dedicated respiratory gills and paired fins,
      the ostracoderms, had heavy bony plates that served as protective
      exoskeletons against invertebrate predators.
    </p>

    <h2>Fossil History</h2>
    <p>
      Dunkleosteus was a giant Devonian armoured placoderm, around 400 million
      years ago. About 530 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion,
      fishlike animals with a notochord and eyes at the front of the body, such
      as Haikouichthys, appear in the fossil record. During the late Cambrian,
      other jawless forms such as conodonts appear. Jawed vertebrates appear in
      the Silurian, with giant armoured placoderms such as Dunkleosteus. Jawed
      fish, too, appeared during the Silurian: the cartilaginous Chondrichthyes
      and the bony Osteichthyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Devonian, fish diversity greatly increased, including among the
      placoderms, lobe-finned fishes, and early sharks, earning the Devonian the
y    </p>

    <h2>Phylogeny</h2>
    <p>
      Fishes are a paraphyletic group, since any clade containing all fish, such
      as the Gnathostomata or Osteichthyes, also contains the clade of tetrapods
      (four-limbed vertebrates, mostly terrestrial), which are usually not
      considered fish. Some tetrapods, such as cetaceans and ichthyosaurs, have
      secondarily acquired a fish-like body shape through convergent evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some modern taxonomists accept that tetrapods, including humans, are
      modified bony fishes, and thus include them in Osteichthyes. The
      biodiversity of extant fish is unevenly distributed; teleosts, bony fishes
      able to protrude their jaws, make up 96% of fish species.
    </p>

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>
      Fishes (excluding tetrapods) are a paraphyletic group, so the class
      "Pisces" is no longer used in formal classification. Traditional
      classification divides fish into three extant classes: "Agnatha",
      Chondrichthyes, and "Osteichthyes", with extinct forms sometimes
      classified within or separate from these groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fish account for more than half of all vertebrate species. As of 2016,<br>
      there are over 32,000 described species of bony fish, over 1,100 species<br>
      of cartilaginous fish, and over 100 species of hagfish and lampreys. A
      third of these fall within the nine largest families, including
      Cyprinidae, Gobiidae, Cichlidae, and others.

      <p>Circulation
The fish heart pumps blood to the gills, where it picks up oxygen. The blood then flows without further pumping to the body,
 from where it returns to the heart.Fish have a closed-loop circulatory system. The heart pumps the blood in a single loop
  throughout the body;
  for comparison, the mammal heart has two loops, one for the lungs to pick up oxygen, one for the body to deliver the oxygen.
   In fish, the heart pumps blood through the gills.</p>

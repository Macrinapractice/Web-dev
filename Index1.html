    The Index were an American garage rock/psychedelic rock band from Grosse
    Pointe, Michigan who were active from 1966â€“1969 and are known for a sound
    characterized by droning guitars, as heard on their two albums, both
    released in 1968. Though they remained largely unknown for a number of
    years, since the 1980s they have come to the attention of garage rock
    collectors and fans.
